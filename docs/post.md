# I Built 3 AI-Driven Projects From Scratchâ€”Hereâ€™s What I Learned (So You Donâ€™t Make My Mistakes, I'm solo developer who build HFT trading and integration apps and have 7+ experience in backend)

Hey everyone, Iâ€™m curiousâ€”how many of you have tried using AI (especially ChatGPT and Claud with Cursor) to build a project from scratch, letting AI handle most of the work instead of manually managing everything yourself?

I started this journey purely for experimentation and learning, and along the way, Iâ€™ve discovered some interesting patterns. Iâ€™d love to share my insights, and if anyone else is interested in this approach, Iâ€™d be happy to share more of my experiences as I continue testing.

## 1. Without a Clear Structure, AI Messes Everything Up

Before starting a project, you need to define project rules, folder structures, and guidelines, otherwise, AIâ€™s output becomes chaotic.

I personally use ChatGPT-4 to structure my projects before diving in. However, the tricky part is that if youâ€™re a beginner or intermediate developer, you might not know the best structure upfrontâ€”and AI canâ€™t fully predict it either.

So, two approaches might work:

- Define a rough structure first, then let AI execute.
- Rush in, build fast, then refine the structure later. (Risky, as it can create a mess and drain your mental energy.)

Neither method is perfect, but over-planning without trying AI first is just as bad as rushing in blindly. I recommend experimenting early to see AIâ€™s potential before finalizing your project structure.

## 2. The More You Try to Control AI, the Worse It Performs

One major thing Iâ€™ve learned: AI struggles with rigid rules. If you try to force AI to follow your specific naming conventions, CSS structures, or folder hierarchies, it often breaks down or produces inconsistent results.

ðŸ”´ Donâ€™t force AI to adopt your style.
ðŸŸ¢ Instead, learn to adapt to AIâ€™s way of working and guide it gently.

For example, in my project, I use custom CSS and global stylesâ€”but when I tried making AI strictly follow my rules, it failed. When I adapted my workflow to let AI generate first and tweak afterward, results improved dramatically.

By the way, Iâ€™m a backend engineer learning frontend development with AI. My programming background is 7+ years, but my AI + frontend journey has only been two months (but I also build firebase app with react in 4 years ago but i forget :D) â€”so Iâ€™m still in the experimentation phase.

## 3. If You Use New Technologies, AI Needs Extra Training

I also realized that AI doesnâ€™t always handle the latest tech well.

For example, I worked with Tailwind 4, and AI constantly made mistakes because it lacked enough training data on the latest version.

ðŸ”¹ Solution: If youâ€™re using a new framework, you MUST feed AI the documentation every time you request something. Otherwise, AI will hallucinate or apply outdated methods.

ðŸš€ My advice: Stick with well-documented, stable technologies unless youâ€™re willing to put in extra effort to teach AI the latest updates.

## 4. Let AI Handle the Execution, Not the Details

When prompting AI to build something, donâ€™t micromanage the implementation details.

ðŸŸ¢ Explain the user flow clearly.
ðŸŸ¢ Let AI decide whatâ€™s necessary.
ðŸŸ¢ Then tweak the output to fix minor mistakes.

Trying to pre-define every step slows down the process and confuses AI. Instead, describe the bigger picture and correct its output as needed.

## 5. AI Learns From Your Codebaseâ€”Be Careful!

As the project grows, AI starts adopting your design patterns and mistakes.

If you start with bad design decisions, AI will repeat and reinforce them across your entire project.

âœ… Set up a strong foundation early to avoid long-term messes.
âœ… Comment your code properlyâ€”not just Markdown documentation, but inline explanations.
âœ… Focus on explaining WHY, not WHAT.

AI **doesnâ€™t need code documentation to understand functionsâ€”it needs context on why you made certain choices.**Just like a human developer, AI benefits from clear reasoning over rigid instructions.

## Final Thoughts: This is Just the Beginning

AI technology is still new, and weâ€™re all still experimenting.

From my experience:

- AI is incredibly powerful, but only if you work with itâ€”not against it.
- Rigid control leads to chaos; adaptability leads to success.
- Your projectâ€™s initial structure and documentation will dictate AIâ€™s long-term performance.

If anyone else is exploring this AI-first development approach, Iâ€™d love to hear your experiences! Also, if youâ€™re interested, Iâ€™ll be sharing more of my findings as I continue testing AI for project development.
